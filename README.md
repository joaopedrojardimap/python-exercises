# University of Toronto | Learn to Program Assignments

This repository contains my solutions for the introductory programming course at the **University of Toronto**. The projects progress from basic logic to complex data processing and algorithmic game design.

##  Project Overview

### Assignment 1: Time Calculation & Timezone Offset
* **Focus:** Arithmetic operators and variable manipulation.
* **Description:** Developed logic to calculate time differences and handle timezone offsets within a 24-hour clock cycle.

### Assignment 2: DNA Processing & Validation
* **Focus:** String manipulation, methods, and iteration.
* **Description:** Implemented functions to validate DNA sequences, manipulate DNA strings and count nucleotides.

### Assignment 3: Word Search Game (Original Implementation)
* **Focus:** Matrix logic (nested lists), file I/O, and boundary validation.
* **Key Feature:** This is a fully functional Word Search engine developed entirely by me.

## Technical Skills

* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Core Concepts:**
    * Algorithmic thinking and flow control.
    * Data parsing from `.txt` files.
    * Modular code structure and function-based architecture.

## Repository Structure

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `a1time_calculation.py` | Logic for time and offset calculations. |
| `a2dna_processing.py` | DNA sequence analysis and validation. |
| `a3.py` | The core Word Search engine (Original Work). |
